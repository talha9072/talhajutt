# Android Developer Portfolio - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Reference-Based Design inspired by modern developer portfolios (Linear, Vercel, GitHub profiles) combined with the structural elements from the reference portfolio, adapted for Android development showcase.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Clean, minimalist SaaS aesthetic with ample whitespace
- Professional credibility through subtle tech-forward details
- Android-focused visual language (Material Design influences without being derivative)
- Content-first hierarchy emphasizing projects and technical expertise

**Services Section:**
- Numbered cards (01-06) with hover lift effect
- Each card: number badge, service icon, title, brief description
- Services: Native Android Apps, Kotlin Development, Firebase Integration, UI/UX Design, App Optimization, Play Store Publishing

**Projects Showcase:**
- Featured project cards with app screenshots/mockups
- Each card: app icon, title, tech stack tags, description, links (GitHub/Play Store)
- Screenshot preview with device frame (Pixel mockup)
- Hover state reveals project details overlay

**Skills Display:**

## Images

**Required Images:**

1. **Hero Section Image** (Right Side):
   - Professional headshot OR Android-themed illustration showing app development
   - Dimensions: 600x600px optimal, square aspect ratio
   - Style: Clean, professional, perhaps with laptop/phone props
   - Alternative: Phone mockup showing one of your apps

2. **About Me Section:**
   - Professional photo in workspace/casual professional setting
   - Dimensions: 500x600px, portrait orientation
   - Background: Clean, minimal, tech environment preferred

3. **Project Screenshots:**
   - 4-6 Android app screenshots in device frames (Pixel mockups)
   - Dimensions: 1080x2340px (standard Android resolution)
   - Show key features, polished UI screens

4. **Technology Logos:**
   - Use icon library (Font Awesome or DevIcons CDN) for tech stack icons
   - Android robot, Kotlin logo, Firebase logo, etc.

**Image Treatment:**
- Rounded corners (rounded-xl to rounded-2xl)
- Subtle shadow for depth (shadow-xl with colored glow)
- Lazy loading for performance
- WebP format with fallbacks

## Accessibility & Interactions

- Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Focus states on all interactive elements (ring-2 ring-primary ring-offset-2)
- Reduced motion support (prefers-reduced-motion query)
- Semantic HTML throughout (section, article, nav tags)
- All images include descriptive alt text
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
- Dark mode toggle in header (persistent preference)

## Technical Notes

- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Smooth scroll behavior (scroll-smooth on html)
- Performance: minimize layout shifts, optimize images, lazy load below fold
- Icons: Use Heroicons or Lucide React via CDN
- Fonts: Preload critical fonts for performance
